Welcome to **AEGIS**!
======================================

**AEGIS** is a scalable toolkit for **large-scale whole-slide image (WSI) processing**, developed by Siddhesh Thakur.

🚀 **What AEGIS offers:**

- **Tissue vs. background segmentation** for H&E, IHC, special stains, and artifact removal
- **Patch-level feature extraction** using 20+ foundation models
- **Slide-level feature extraction** via 5+ pretrained model backbones
- Native support for **OpenSlide**, **CuCIM**, and **PIL-compatible** formats

Explore the **end-to-end pipeline**, from segmentation to slide-level representation — all powered by the latest **foundation models** for computational pathology.
